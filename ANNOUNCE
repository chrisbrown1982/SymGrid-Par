		    The SymGrid-Par Infrastructure


We  are  pleased to  announce  the  release of the  SymGrid-Par v0.3.3
middleware for parallel  symbolic computation.  This prototype version
of  SymGrid-Par adds  support for  the SCSCP  protocol and  provides a
coordination server to orchestrate  parallel execution.  It comes with
an  implementation of  several  general skeletons  and with  examples,
using  these skeletons  to  realise parallelism.  This version  should
mainly be of interest for middleware developers.

The  role of  SymGrid-Par is  to orchestrate  parallel  processes that
cooperate  in  solving one  symbolic  computation  problem.  This  may
involve  the cooperation  of  several computer  algebra  systems in  a
wide-area, Grid-style  network.  Central  to its design  are languages
that provide a high level of  parallelism and that are easy to use for
the users of computer algebra systems.  We achieve this by building on
parallel  extensions of the  functional programming  language Haskell,
defining  patterns  of   parallel  computation  (skeletons)  in  these
languages,  and provide  these skeletons  via well  defined interfaces
directly in the computer algebra system.
